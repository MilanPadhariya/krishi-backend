On startup the server searches this dir for files with the naming scheme
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<anything here>.sql
For example:
2023-08-22-0208-delete columns.sql
The first part of the name is a time and it should be the time of file creation but it isn't actually used for anything. It's just there to make sure the file name is unique.
The first time the server sees the file it will run it. If the file runs successfully (it is run inside a transaction block). It's recorded in the "--migration" table and not run again.

You may not need to run a migration though if you are only making simple changes as the object repo system can handle things like adding columns automatically
